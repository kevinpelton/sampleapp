== Sample Application 
Uses twitter bootstrap & will_paginate to display public hospital data from data.gov.  

== Loading Data
from within the lib/tasks run the following 2 commands
> ruby convert_to_seeds.rb > ../../db/seeds.rb
> rake db:seeds
This loads the data into the seeds.rb file from the csv file from data.gov  
This approach makes it easy to load the data on heroku using heroku rake db:seed although tap is also an option.
